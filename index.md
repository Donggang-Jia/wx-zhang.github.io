## About Me
My name is Wenxuan Zhang. I am a master student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu) graduate group at [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.upenn.edu), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).  Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [School of Mathematical Science](http://math.bnu.edu.cn/xyxw/index.htm), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn) in 2019. 


## Research
I am interested in machine learning, lifelong learning, and optimization. I hope to get inspirations for machine learning methods from mathematical and statistical results. I am now doing my master's thesis in non-stationary lifelong learning, advisied by Professor [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/). I am also interested in statistical explanation in machine learning. 

If you are interested in my previously researches and projects, feel free to review [this page](/projects)


## Recent Activities
I spent summer 2020 at [RED](https://www.xiaohongshu.com) as a machine learning intern. My work was mainly on deep net and [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org) based speaker verification.
