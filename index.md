My name is Wenxuan Zhang. I am a master student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science graduate group at University of Pennsylvania.  Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University in 2019. 

I am interested in machine learning, lifelong learning, and optimization. I hope to get inspirations for machine learning methods from mathematical and statistical results. I am now doing my master's thesis in non-stationary lifelong learning, advisied by Professor Eric Eaton. I am also interested in statistical explanation of machine learning.
