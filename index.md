## About Me
My name is Wenxuan Zhang. I am a master student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science] graduate group at [Department of Mathematics], [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).  Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [School of Mathematical Science], [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn) in 2019. 


## Research
I am interested in machine learning, lifelong learning, and optimization. I hope to get inspirations for machine learning methods from mathematical and statistical results. I am now doing my master's thesis in non-stationary lifelong learning, advisied by Professor [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/). I am also interested in statistical explanation in machine learning.

## Recent Activities
I spent summer 2020 at [RED](https://www.xiaohongshu.com) as a machine learning intern. My work was mainly on deep net and [Kaldi] based speaker verification.
