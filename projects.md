## Stochastic Block Model and Markov Chain Monte Carlo based recovery method

[code](https://github.com/wx-zhang/SBM-MCMC/tree/main) || [paper](/recourses/SBM.pdf)
This project mainly studied the problem of community detection by a generative model--stochastic block model. First, the author introduced some basic concepts of the rstochastic block model and the theoretical basis related to the recovery of group tags from connection information. Secondly, the author adopted an improved Markov chain Monte Carlo method to solve the recovery problem. Then, the author constructed the FBS American football team network model based on the stochastic block model, proved that the model can be partially recovered, and recovered the system through MCMC. The numerical results from the clear data that satisfy the theoretical assumption and the noise but real data all satisfy the theoretical results.
